In second assignment, student will implement a secret code generator and decoder. The system works be building an encoding tree based on two sets of input from the user: an ordered alphabet containing all the symbols that will be encoded and a set of mutations that are used to change the structure of the coding tree. Given these two pieces of information, the system can build an encoding tree. This tree can be used to convert plain text sentences into a secret pattern of 1's and 0's that could be transmitted to someone else. Anyone who intercepts the message will have great difficulty figuring out what it says without the encoding rules. However, if the recipient has your software and has the two keys, the alphabet and the mutation list, they can build the encoding tree and use it to decode the string of 1's and 0's back to plain text.
